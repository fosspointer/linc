# Linc Guide (#0): Getting Started

This is a guide for those interested in learning the Linc language (Linc Is Not C). Its mainly targetted at programming enthusiasts or beginners wanting to learn the language, though some level of knowledge of dealing with computers is assumed. Before proceeding with the guide, make sure you have successfully installed the Linc environment on your system, which should be available in the `$PATH` variable. You can ensure this by running the `lincenv` commmand in your shell of choice (i.e. inside of a terminal), which should start the Linc Interactive Shell. You can exit out of this shell by simply entering `q`. If the above command doesn't work, make sure you follow the [Installation Guide](../readme.md).

If you're working with Visual Studio Code, it is recommended to use the [Linc Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fosspointer.linc) extension, which supports basic syntax highlighting and bracket-pair insertion to make the programming experience easier.
