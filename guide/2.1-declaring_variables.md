# Linc Guide (#2.1): Variables in Linc

This is how you define a variable in Linc (note that names encapsulated in angled brackets act as placeholders):

```linc
<varname>: <typename> = <value>
```

- `<varname>`: the identifier/name of a variable, for example `foo`, `bar`, `hello_word123`, etc... (note that all identifiers are case-sensitive). 

- `<typename>`: the variable's storage type (see [data types](#data-types)).

- `<value>`: the expression the value is assigned to (expression meaning it can be a value or even an operation; in all cases the resulting value is what is stored).

## Data Types

### Number Data Types

In Linc, fixed width type naming is used (i.e. every number consists of a single-letter descriptor as well as its size in bits). Keep in mind that the term "integer" describes a 'whole' value, whereas "floating-point" numbers describe rational-number approximations with variable width precision. Here is a list of all descriptors for numbers:

| Number Type            | Descriptor | Valid Sizes (bits) |
| ---------------------: | :--------: | :----------------- |
| Unsigned Integers      | `i`        | 8, 16, 32, 64      |
| Signed Integers        | `u`        | 8, 16, 32, 64      |
| Floating-point Numbers | `f`        | 32, 64             |

For example, `i32`, `f64` and `u8` are all valid types, but `f8` isn't, as floating-point numbers can only be 32 or 64 bits in Linc. 

Here are some examples on how variables work in Linc (keep in mind that `//` is used to introduce comments, i.e. pieces of text that describe the code and are ignored, spanning from the `//` symbol until the end of the line):

```linc
foo: i32 = 5; // i32 = 32 bit signed integer (note that numbers with no decimal point are i32 by default)
foo2: i32 = 7i; // alternatively, `i` and `i32` can be used as suffixes for i32 literals
foo3: i8 = -42i32; // the number is now 8 bits (still signed), meaning its range is now from -128 to +127 

bar: f32 = 2.71f; // the suffixes `f`, `f32` are used for f32 literals (note that a number containing a decimal point are f32 by default)
```

### Other Data Types

Numbers have shown to be really useful in programming. However, our need to store data goes beyond just numbers. It is also really common to store strings of information in text format using the `string` data type, or information that can only have two possible states (usually **true** or **false**, yes or no, etc...), for which the `bool` datatype is used. Additionally, individual characters in a string use the `char` datatype. Finally, the `void` type is used to denote the absence of a value which, however, isn't normally used in variables. Here's a demontration of the data types described above:

```linc
fn main() {
    foo: char = 'A'; // the ascii letter 'A' is stored in this variable
    foo2: char = 65c; // alternatively, 65 can be used (since ASCII 'A' corresponds to that number)

    bar: bool = true; // bar is a two-state variable holding the value true
    not_bar: bool = false; // not_bar is similar, but given the value false

    some_text: string = "hello world"; // strings of text are represented using double quotes and the `string` data type
}
```
